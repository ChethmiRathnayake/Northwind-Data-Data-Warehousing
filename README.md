## 🚀 Project Overview
- Designed a **Data Warehouse schema** (fact & dimension tables) based on the Northwind dataset.  
- Implemented **ETL processes** using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).  
- Built an **OLAP cube** with SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).  
- Developed **Power BI reports** for insightful business decision-making.  
- Prepared a **detailed report** documenting methodology, architecture, and results.
